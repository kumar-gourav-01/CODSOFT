I've developed personal portfolio website using a combination of HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript magic.
The website is a dynamic showcase of various sections, each serving a distinct purpose:

➤ At the top is the Header Section, where I add a logo of mine, introduce myself briefly with tagline and set the tone for the site.
📸 Moving on to the About Section, I've given a glimpse into who I am, accompanied by an image and a succinct biography including education, skills, experience and hobbies.
🏅 In the Skills Section, I've spotlighted my core competencies, putting my skillset on display.
👨🏻‍💻 The Projects Section is a highlight reel of some remarkable undertakings, complete with descriptions and convenient links for exploration.
📋 In the Resume Section, I've provided a link to download my resume in PDF format.
📞 To ensure we stay connected, the Contact Section provides all the ways to reach out and get in touch.
📃 Lastly, the Footer ties everything together with copyright details and a few additional information.

The journey of crafting this portfolio website has been nothing short of enlightening. It provided me with a real-world platform to apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS and even a bit of JavaScript. As I move forward, I'm brimming with enthusiasm to further nurture and elevate my prowess in web development.
